    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> I'm Danielle Kaneti, 23 years old, living in Moshav Sharona in the Lower Galilee.</p>
    <p>I grew up with 3 siblings, 10 dogs, and a family ranch with about 100 horses in our backyard — a big part of who I am and where I come from.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
      <p>Outside of my academic and professional life, I find joy in movement and balance.</p>
      <p>I love dancing, working out, and of course — riding horses, which has been part of my life since childhood. 
        These activities keep me grounded, energized, and connected to myself.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p> Im  am currently in my second year of studying Business Administration, specializing in Management Information Systems.</p> 
    <p>For my first year, I was honored to receive the President’s Excellence Award — something I never took for granted.
    I owe much of this achievement to the words of my brother that have stayed with me throughout:  
      <em>“What comes easy, goes easy. Everything takes persistence and hard work — and in the end it pays off. Those who stick with it, work hard, and never give up — get results.”</em></p>  
    <p>His voice became a reminder to keep going, and a source of motivation to stay focused and always give my best.</p>
